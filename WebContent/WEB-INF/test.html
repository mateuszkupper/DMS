From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia
The United States of America (/əˈmɛrɪkə/; USA),
commonly known as the United States (U.S.) or America,
is a federal republic[19][20] composed of 50 states, a federal
district, five major self-governing territories, and various
possessions.
[fn 6] Forty-eight of the fifty states and the
federal district are contiguous and located in North America
between Canada and Mexico. The state of Alaska is in the
northwest corner of North America, bordered by Canada to
the east and across the Bering Strait from Russia to the west.
The state of Hawaii is an archipelago in the mid-Pacific
Ocean. The U.S. territories are scattered about the Pacific
Ocean and the Caribbean Sea, stretching across nine time
zones. The extremely diverse geography, climate and
wildlife of the United States make it one of the world's 17
megadiverse countries.
[22][23]
At 3.8 million square miles (9.8 million km2
)
[11] and with
over 324 million people, the United States is the world's
third- or fourth-largest country by total area,
[fn 7] thirdlargest
by land area, and the third-most populous. It is one of
the world's most ethnically diverse and multicultural
nations, and is home to the world's largest immigrant
population.
[28] The capital is Washington, D.C., and the
largest city is New York City; nine other major metropolitan
areas—each with at least 4.5 million inhabitants—are Los
Angeles, Chicago, Dallas, Houston, Philadelphia, Miami,
Atlanta, Boston, and San Francisco.
Paleo-Indians migrated from Asia to the North American
mainland at least 15,000 years ago.[29] European
colonization began in the 16th century. The United States
emerged from 13 British colonies along the East Coast.
Numerous disputes between Great Britain and the colonies
following the Seven Years' War led to the American
Revolution, which began in 1775. On July 4, 1776, during
the course of the American Revolutionary War, the colonies
unanimously adopted the Declaration of Independence. The
war ended in 1783 with recognition of the independence of
the United States by Great Britain, representing the first
successful war of independence against a European
power.
[30] The current constitution was adopted in 1788,
after the Articles of Confederation, adopted in 1781, were
felt to have provided inadequate federal powers. The first
ten amendments, collectively named the Bill of Rights, were
ratified in 1791 and designed to guarantee many
fundamental civil liberties.

The United States embarked on a vigorous expansion across
North America throughout the 19th century,
[31] displacing
Native American tribes, acquiring new territories, and
gradually admitting new states until it spanned the continent
by 1848.[31] During the second half of the 19th century, the
American Civil War led to the end of legal slavery in the
country.
[32][33] By the end of that century, the United States
extended into the Pacific Ocean,[34] and its economy, driven
in large part by the Industrial Revolution, began to soar.
[35]
The Spanish–American War and World War I confirmed the
country's status as a global military power. The United
States emerged from World War II as a global superpower,
the first country to develop nuclear weapons, the only
country to use them in warfare, and a permanent member of
the United Nations Security Council. The end of the Cold
War and the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991 left the
United States as the world's sole superpower.
[36] The U.S. is
a founding member of the United Nations, World Bank,
International Monetary Fund, Organization of American
States (OAS), and other international organizations.
The United States is a highly developed country, with the
world's largest economy by nominal GDP and secondlargest
economy by PPP. Though its population is only 4.3%
of the world total,[37] Americans hold nearly 40% of the
total wealth in the world.[38] The United States ranks among
the highest in several measures of socioeconomic
performance, including average wage,
[39] human
development, per capita GDP, and productivity per
person.[40] While the U.S. economy is considered postindustrial,
characterized by the dominance of services and
knowledge economy, the manufacturing sector remains the
second-largest in the world.[41] Accounting for
approximately a quarter of global GDP[42] and a third of
global military spending,
[43] the United States is the world's
foremost economic and military power. The United States is
a prominent political and cultural force internationally, and a
leader in scientific research and technological
innovations.

Etymology
In 1507, the German cartographer Martin Waldseemüller produced a world map on which he named the lands
of the Western Hemisphere "America" in honor of the Italian explorer and cartographer Amerigo Vespucci
(Latin: Americus Vespucius).[45] The first documentary evidence of the phrase "United States of America" is
from a letter dated January 2, 1776, written by Stephen Moylan, Esq., George Washington's aide-de-camp and
Muster-Master General of the Continental Army. Addressed to Lt. Col. Joseph Reed, Moylan expressed his
wish to carry the "full and ample powers of the United States of America" to Spain to assist in the revolutionary
war effort.[47][48][49]
The first known publication of the phrase "United States of America" was in an anonymous essay in The
Virginia Gazette newspaper in Williamsburg, Virginia, on April 6, 1776.[50][51] The second draft of the Articles
of Confederation, prepared by John Dickinson and completed by June 17, 1776, at the latest, declared "The
America is named after
Italian explorer
Amerigo
Vespucci.
[45][46]
Artist's re-creation of the Kincaid Site
from the prehistoric Mississippian
culture, as it may have looked at its
peak (1050–1400)
name of this Confederation shall be the 'United States of America.'"[52] The final
version of the Articles sent to the states for ratification in late 1777 contains the
sentence "The Stile of this Confederacy shall be 'The United States of America' ".[53]
In June 1776, Thomas Jefferson wrote the phrase "UNITED STATES OF
AMERICA" in all capitalized letters in the headline of his "original Rough draught"
of the Declaration of Independence.
[54][55] This draft of the document did not
surface until June 21, 1776, and it is unclear whether it was written before or after
Dickinson used the term in his June 17 draft of the Articles of Confederation.[52] In
the final Fourth of July version of the Declaration, the title was changed to read,
"The unanimous Declaration of the thirteen united States of America".[56] The
preamble of the Constitution states "...establish this Constitution for the United
States of America."
The short form "United States" is also standard. Other common forms are the "U.S.",
the "USA", and "America". Colloquial names are the "U.S. of A." and,
internationally, the "States". "Columbia", a name popular in poetry and songs of the late 18th century, derives
its origin from Christopher Columbus; it appears in the name "District of Columbia".[57] In non-English
languages, the name is frequently the translation of either the "United States" or "United States of America",
and colloquially as "America". In addition, an abbreviation (e.g. USA) is sometimes used.[58]
The phrase "United States" was originally plural, a description of a collection of independent states—e.g., "the
United States are"—including in the Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution, ratified in 1865.
The singular form—e.g., "the United States is"—became popular after the end of the American Civil War. The
singular form is now standard; the plural form is retained in the idiom "these United States".[59] The difference
is more significant than usage; it is a difference between a collection of states and a unit.[60]
A citizen of the United States is an "American". "United States", "American" and "U.S." refer to the country
adjectivally ("American values", "U.S. forces"). In English, the word "American" rarely refers to topics or
subjects not connected with the United States.[61]

History</h1><p>
Indigenous and European contact
The first inhabitants of North America migrated from Siberia by way of
the Bering land bridge and arrived at least 15,000 years ago, though
increasing evidence suggests an even earlier arrival.[29] Some, such as
the pre-Columbian Mississippian culture, developed advanced
agriculture, grand architecture, and state-level societies.[62] The first
Europeans to arrive in territory of the modern United States were
Spanish conquistadors such as Juan Ponce de León, and made their first
contacts in Florida in 1513. The native population declined for various
reasons, primarily from diseases such as smallpox and measles.
Violence was not a significant factor in the overall decline among
Native Americans, though conflict among themselves and with
Europeans affected specific tribes and various colonial
settlements.[63][64][65][66][67][68] In the Hawaiian Islands, the earliest
indigenous inhabitants arrived around 1 AD from Polynesia. Europeans
under the British explorer Captain James Cook arrived in the Hawaiian
Islands in 1778.
Saint Augustine, Florida, the oldest
continuously occupied Europeanestablished
settlement in the
continental United States (1565)
The signing of the Mayflower
Compact, 1620
In the early days of colonization, many European settlers were subject to food shortages, disease, and attacks
from Native Americans. Native Americans were also often at war with neighboring tribes and allied with
Europeans in their colonial wars. At the same time, however, many natives and settlers came to depend on each
other. Settlers traded for food and animal pelts, natives for guns, ammunition and other European wares.[69]
Natives taught many settlers where, when and how to cultivate corn, beans and squash. European missionaries
and others felt it was important to "civilize" the Native Americans and urged them to adopt European
agricultural techniques and lifestyles.[70][71]
Settlements
After Spain sent Columbus on his first voyage to the New World in
1492, other explorers followed. The Spanish set up the first settlements
in Florida and New Mexico such as Saint Augustine [72] and Santa Fe.
The French established their own as well along the Mississippi River.
Successful English settlement on the eastern coast of North America
began with the Virginia Colony in 1607 at Jamestown and the Pilgrims'
Plymouth Colony in 1620. Early experiments in communal living failed
until the introduction of private farm holdings.[73] Many settlers were
dissenting Christian groups who came seeking religious freedom. The
continent's first elected legislative assembly, Virginia's House of
Burgesses created in 1619, the Mayflower Compact, signed by the
Pilgrims before disembarking, and the Fundamental Orders of
Connecticut, established precedents for the pattern of representative
self-government and constitutionalism that would develop throughout
the American colonies.[74][75]
Most settlers in every colony were small farmers, but other industries
developed within a few decades as varied as the settlements. Cash crops
included tobacco, rice and wheat. Extraction industries grew up in furs,
fishing and lumber. Manufacturers produced rum and ships, and by the
late colonial period Americans were producing one-seventh of the
world's iron supply.
[76] Cities eventually dotted the coast to support
local economies and serve as trade hubs. English colonists were
supplemented by waves of Scotch-Irish and other groups. As coastal
land grew more expensive freed indentured servants pushed further
west.[77]
A large-scale slave trade with English privateers was begun.[78] The life expectancy of slaves was much higher
in North America than further south, because of less disease and better food and treatment, leading to a rapid
increase in the numbers of slaves.[79][80] Colonial society was largely divided over the religious and moral
implications of slavery and colonies passed acts for and against the practice.[81][82] But by the turn of the 18th
century, African slaves were replacing indentured servants for cash crop labor, especially in southern
regions.[83]
With the British colonization of Georgia in 1732, the 13 colonies that would become the United States of
America were established.[84] All had local governments with elections open to most free men, with a growing
devotion to the ancient rights of Englishmen and a sense of self-government stimulating support for
republicanism.[85] With extremely high birth rates, low death rates, and steady settlement, the colonial
population grew rapidly. Relatively small Native American populations were eclipsed.[86] The Christian
revivalist movement of the 1730s and 1740s known as the Great Awakening fueled interest in both religion and
religious liberty.
[87]
The Declaration of Independence: the
Committee of Five presenting their
draft to the Second Continental
Congress in 1776
During the Seven Years' War (in America, known as the French and Indian War), British forces seized Canada
from the French, but the francophone population remained politically isolated from the southern colonies.
Excluding the Native Americans, who were being conquered and displaced, the 13 British colonies had a
population of over 2.1 million in 1770, about one-third that of Britain. Despite continuing new arrivals, the rate
of natural increase was such that by the 1770s only a small minority of Americans had been born overseas.[88]
The colonies' distance from Britain had allowed the development of self-government, but their success
motivated monarchs to periodically seek to reassert royal authority.
[89]
Independence and expansion (1776–1865)
The American Revolutionary War was the first successful colonial war
of independence against a European power. Americans had developed
an ideology of "republicanism" asserting that government rested on the
will of the people as expressed in their local legislatures. They
demanded their rights as Englishmen and "no taxation without
representation". The British insisted on administering the empire
through Parliament, and the conflict escalated into war.
[90]
Following the passage of the Lee Resolution, on July 2, 1776, which
was the actual vote for independence, the Second Continental Congress
adopted the Declaration of Independence on July 4, which proclaimed,
in a long preamble, that humanity is created equal in their unalienable
rights and that those rights were not being protected by Great Britain,
and declared, in the words of the resolution, that the Thirteen Colonies
were independent states and had no allegiance to the British crown in the United States. The fourth day of July
is celebrated annually as Independence Day. In 1777, the Articles of Confederation established a weak
government that operated until 1789.[91]
Britain recognized the independence of the United States following their defeat at Yorktown in 1781.[92] In the
peace treaty of 1783, American sovereignty was recognized from the Atlantic coast west to the Mississippi
River. Nationalists led the Philadelphia Convention of 1787 in writing the United States Constitution, ratified in
state conventions in 1788. The federal government was reorganized into three branches, on the principle of
creating salutary checks and balances, in 1789. George Washington, who had led the revolutionary army to
victory, was the first president elected under the new constitution. The Bill of Rights, forbidding federal
restriction of personal freedoms and guaranteeing a range of legal protections, was adopted in 1791.[93]
Although the federal government criminalized the international slave trade in 1808, after 1820, cultivation of
the highly profitable cotton crop exploded in the Deep South, and along with it, the slave population.[94][95][96]
The Second Great Awakening, especially 1800–1840, converted millions to evangelical Protestantism. In the
North, it energized multiple social reform movements, including abolitionism;
[97] in the South, Methodists and
Baptists proselytized among slave populations.[98]
Americans' eagerness to expand westward prompted a long series of American Indian Wars.
[99] The Louisiana
Purchase of French-claimed territory in 1803 almost doubled the nation's area.[100] The War of 1812, declared
against Britain over various grievances and fought to a draw, strengthened U.S. nationalism.[101] A series of
military incursions into Florida led Spain to cede it and other Gulf Coast territory in 1819.[102] Expansion was
aided by steam power, when steamboats began traveling along America's large water systems, which were
connected by new canals, such as the Erie and the I&M; then, even faster railroads began their stretch across
the nation's land.	<p>
